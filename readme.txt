== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Is MightyShare free?=

Yes! You can use MightyShare for free using our free account allowing you 50 renders a month. [Paid plans](https://mightyshare.io/pricing/) start at $5 that allow you to generate hundreds of social images.

=How does image generation work?=

The image generation process is performed on our servers. This is done by the plugin creating a unique signed URL that allows your API Key to generate a social share image on our server. The URL is then put in your head tag to be used as an og:image. If you have Yoast SEO or RankMath installed the plugin will automatically write their og:images if enabled. Otherwise the plugin will create an og:image meta tag with your unique URL. [Read our Privacy Policy](https://mightyshare.io/privacy-policy/)

=When is an image rendered?=

The MightyShare plugin places a signed MightShare image URL onto your meta tags. Images aren't rendered until that URL is visited (either by a user or crawler). Typically you'll see a 5 second delay in a social preview image loading when it's first shared.

=Why aren't my images showing up?=

If you are using an SEO plugin be sure to have a default image set for the type of content you want MightyShare to show on. For example in Yoast SEO you need to go to the Facebook section and set a default Open Graph image, this allows MightyShare to run filtering those meta tags. Additionally make sure you've cleared any caching mechanisms you may have. Still having issues? [Contact Us](https://mightyshare.io/contact/).
